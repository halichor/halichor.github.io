                                Lycoria's muse. The pair exude an air of elegance and share a fondness for
                                attention, but Lucien's inclination for introspection contrasts with Jehan's
                                occasional bouts of spirited impulsiveness. Their fates, tightly bound, play out
                                against a backdrop of divine conflict, with Jehan's choices casting long shadows
                                over the Omen's life. As the consequences of each action weigh heavily on the
                                Omen,
                                their loyalty to the goddess they once served without question begins to erode,
                                giving way to a growing, silent resentment.</p>

                                target of divine punishment. In the shadow of their rebellion, Vaelor begins to
                                transform: the endless cycle of rebirth falters, giving rise to the unsettling
                                reality of true death‚Äîa concept that redefines the essence of existence. Lucien,
                                once the target of divine retribution, finds himself in an unfamiliar realm,
                                where

                                <p>As the first of the Omens and the Watcher of Lycoria‚Äôs Muse, Lucien stands within the
                                    celestial courts of the Umbral Court as a Fatekeeper of Vernath, tasked with
                                    interpreting and conveying the Abyssal Sovereign‚Äôs will to the gods. Positioned
                                    between the divine entities' expectations and the intricate politics of the cosmic
                                    hierarchy, his role as an Omen binds him to the whims of Lycoria and her peers,
                                    where his autonomy is constrained by the ever-present influence of celestial
                                    authority and the unforgiving consequences of divine displeasure.</p>

                                <p>Lucien stands poised at the intersection of duty and desire in Nytharael. Since its
                                    dawn, he has been its Omen‚Äîa figure revered in all of Vaelor yet burdened by the
                                    weight of his role, navigating the delicate balance between divine decree and
                                    personal autonomy as shadows of doubt weave through his mind.</p>
                                <p>But now, his once-unquestioned path trembles with uncertainty. Lucien's heart,
                                    burdened by the weight of past glories and the looming responsibilities ahead, aches
                                    for clarity. Within him stirs a rebellion against the confines of his role,
                                    grappling with the relentless hand of fate.</p>

                                <p>Lucien's adherence to divine directives and his place within the hierarchy hinge on
                                    acceptance. Initially compliant with Vernath's counsel to respect Lycoria's
                                    authority and avoid interference, he begins to weigh the potential repercussions of
                                    defying the goddess. Enduring cycles of subservience and retribution, Lucien faces
                                    Lycoria's wrath and the consequences of his decisions, grappling with the idea that
                                    his pursuit of external validation and conformity may not justify the personal
                                    anguish it entails. This introspection propels him into a realm of self-discovery,
                                    where he begins to question his own <txt-em>worth</txt-em> beyond divine
                                    expectations and confronts the consequences of his actions, unsettling the
                                    established order of the realms.</p>

                                <p>During a sacred festival venerating Lycoria, Jehan's inadvertent actions trigger
                                    Roun's recollection of past lives, giving rise to the first Shadow. This breach of
                                    decorum taints his realm with a corrupted soul, provoking her divine wrath. Lucien,
                                    faithful to Vernath as his creator, initially heeds his guidance but does not wield
                                    authority over Omens or the Herald. When he returns prematurely from the Hall of
                                    Anamnesis, where he accompanies Jehan in search of the book detailing Roun's past
                                    lives, Lycoria imprisons him for his and Jehan‚Äôs extended absence. His punishment
                                    begins with having his wings torn out as <txt-em>retribution</txt-em> for his
                                    disappearance, and he is later struck blind following Jehan's unleashing of the
                                    first Shadow‚Äîan allegory of the notion that ignorance may be bliss, contrasting with
                                    the corruption that forbidden knowledge can bring.</p>

                                <p>In Nytharael, Lucien's <txt-em>vanity</txt-em> is an open secret, whispered among its
                                    inhabitants who flock to catch glimpses of the Omen whenever he graces their
                                    presence, often more eagerly than they do for Jehan‚ÄîMuse of the goddess herself.
                                    Initially, Lucien prefers observing Jehan and the realm from a distance, reluctant
                                    to be swayed from his esteemed role as the first of the Omens and Vesna‚Äôs cherished
                                    one. Yet over time, he develops a hunger for adoration. This longing intensifies
                                    after Lycoria punishes him for the second time, this time for the petty offense of
                                    relishing the Nytharans' favor and attention, which seem to eclipse their devotion
                                    to their own goddess. From then on, Lucien learns to bask in the spotlight,
                                    relishing the attention until it morphs into something darker.</p>

                                <p>All Lucien desires is an unwavering pursuit of autonomy within Vaelor‚Äôs hierarchy.
                                    Initially constrained by Vernath's guidance and burdened by the consequences of
                                    Jehan's deeds, his desire metamorphoses into a relentless quest for genuine autonomy
                                    and freedom from external limitations. His aspiration evolves into a fervent longing
                                    to unravel the intricacies of divine authority and redefine his own identity. In
                                    doing so, Lucien aims to navigate the delicate <txt-em>balance</txt-em> between his
                                    role as an Omen and the expectations imposed by his creator, endeavoring to forge a
                                    path that surpasses prescribed roles and norms revolving around his place in Vaelor.

                                <p>Lucien finds himself entangled in the intricate power dynamics of the Umbral Court,
                                    where the gods, particularly Lycoria, struggle against the constraints imposed by
                                    Vernath's guidance. As a Fatekeeper and Omen, he occupies the nexus of divine will
                                    and mortal affairs, often bearing the brunt of the gods' frustrations when unable to
                                    fulfill Vernath's mandates. This ongoing conflict sparks a profound yearning within
                                    Lucien for autonomy within the cosmic hierarchy.</p>
                                <p>Achieving this autonomy requires him to navigate the delicate balance between divine
                                    expectations and personal <txt-em>agency</txt-em>. He aspires to transcend his role
                                    as a mere mediator and scapegoat in divine state of affairs, striving to redefine
                                    his identity beyond mere adherence to Vernath's will. This endeavor compels him to
                                    confront the gods' demands directly, while simultaneously unraveling the mysteries
                                    of his own existence and purpose in a realm where divine authority is both coveted
                                    and contested.</p>
