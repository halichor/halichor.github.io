                                <p class="dropcap">Lucien is the first of the Omens and the Watcher
                                    of
                                    Lycoria's muse. The pair exude an air of elegance and share a fondness for
                                    attention, but Lucien's inclination for introspection contrasts with Jehan's
                                    occasional bouts of spirited impulsiveness. Their fates, tightly bound, play out
                                    against a backdrop of divine conflict, with Jehan's choices casting long shadows
                                    over the Omen's life. As the consequences of each action weigh heavily on the
                                    Omen,
                                    their loyalty to the goddess they once served without question begins to erode,
                                    giving way to a growing, silent resentment.</p>
                                <p><strong>T</strong>heir defiance, however, brings significant

                                    Jehan strays from Lycoria‚Äôs will, Lucien bears the brunt of her fury, becoming
                                    the
                                    target of divine punishment. In the shadow of their rebellion, Vaelor begins to
                                    transform: the endless cycle of rebirth falters, giving rise to the unsettling
                                    reality of true death‚Äîa concept that redefines the essence of existence. Lucien,
                                    once the target of divine retribution, finds himself in an unfamiliar realm,
                                    where
                                    adoration, eternal yet solitary, awaited him in ways unforeseen.</p>

Positioned between the divine entities' expectations and the intricate politics of the cosmic hierarchy, his role as an Omen binds him to the whims of Lycoria and her peers, where his autonomy is constrained by the ever-present influence of celestial authority and the unforgiving consequences of divine displeasure.</p>

                                     <p>Lucien stands poised at the intersection of duty and desire in Nytharael. Since its dawn, he has been its Omen‚Äîa figure revered in all of Vaelor yet burdened by the weight of his role, navigating the delicate balance between divine decree and personal autonomy as shadows of doubt weave through his mind.</p>
                                     <p>But now, his once-unquestioned path trembles with uncertainty. Lucien's heart, burdened by the weight of past glories and the looming responsibilities ahead, aches for clarity. Within him stirs a rebellion against the confines of his role, grappling with the relentless hand of fate.</p>

                                     <p>Lucien's adherence to divine directives and his place within the hierarchy hinge on acceptance. Initially compliant with Vernath's counsel to respect Lycoria's authority and avoid interference, he begins to weigh the potential repercussions of defying the goddess. Enduring cycles of subservience and retribution, Lucien faces Lycoria's wrath and the consequences of his decisions, grappling with the idea that his pursuit of external validation and conformity may not justify the personal anguish it entails. This introspection propels him into a realm of self-discovery, where he begins to question his own <txt-em>worth</txt-em> beyond divine expectations and confronts the consequences of his actions, unsettling the established order of the realms.</p>

                                    <h3>The ghost.</h3>
                                     <p>During a sacred festival venerating Lycoria, Jehan's inadvertent actions trigger Roun's recollection of past lives, giving rise to the first Shadow. This breach of decorum taints his realm with a corrupted soul, provoking her divine wrath. Lucien, faithful to Vernath as his creator, initially heeds his guidance but does not wield authority over Omens or the Herald. When he returns prematurely from the Hall of Anamnesis, where he accompanies Jehan in search of the book detailing Roun's past lives, Lycoria imprisons him for his and Jehan‚Äôs extended absence. His punishment begins with having his wings torn out as <txt-em>retribution</txt-em> for his disappearance, and he is later struck blind following Jehan's unleashing of the first Shadow‚Äîan allegory of the notion that ignorance may be bliss, contrasting with the corruption that forbidden knowledge can bring.</p>

                                    <h3>The secret(s).</h3>
                                     <p>In Nytharael, Lucien's <txt-em>vanity</txt-em> is an open secret, whispered among its inhabitants who flock to catch glimpses of the Omen whenever he graces their presence, often more eagerly than they do for Jehan‚ÄîMuse of the goddess herself. Initially, Lucien prefers observing Jehan and the realm from a distance, reluctant to be swayed from his esteemed role as the first of the Omens and Vesna‚Äôs cherished one. Yet over time, he develops a hunger for adoration. This longing intensifies after Lycoria punishes him for the second time, this time for the petty offense of relishing the Nytharans' favor and attention, which seem to eclipse their devotion to their own goddess. From then on, Lucien learns to bask in the spotlight, relishing the attention until it morphs into something darker.</p>

                                     <p>All Lucien desires is an unwavering pursuit of autonomy within Vaelor‚Äôs hierarchy. Initially constrained by Vernath's guidance and burdened by the consequences of Jehan's deeds, his desire metamorphoses into a relentless quest for genuine autonomy and freedom from external limitations. His aspiration evolves into a fervent longing to unravel the intricacies of divine authority and redefine his own identity. In doing so, Lucien aims to navigate the delicate <txt-em>balance</txt-em> between his role as an Omen and the expectations imposed by his creator, endeavoring to forge a path that surpasses prescribed roles and norms revolving around his place in Vaelor.</p>

                                     <p>Lucien finds himself entangled in the intricate power dynamics of the Umbral Court, where the gods, particularly Lycoria, struggle against the constraints imposed by Vernath's guidance. As a Fatekeeper and Omen, he occupies the nexus of divine will and mortal affairs, often bearing the brunt of the gods' frustrations when unable to fulfill Vernath's mandates. This ongoing conflict sparks a profound yearning within Lucien for autonomy within the cosmic hierarchy.</p>
                                     <p>Achieving this autonomy requires him to navigate the delicate balance between divine expectations and personal <txt-em>agency</txt-em>. He aspires to transcend his role as a mere mediator and scapegoat in divine state of affairs, striving to redefine his identity beyond mere adherence to Vernath's will. This endeavor compels him to confront the gods' demands directly, while simultaneously unraveling the mysteries of his own existence and purpose in a realm where divine authority is both coveted and contested.</p>
